Description
Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its
features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by
customers. We also released a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.
This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great
houses.

Context
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle
and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimat
ed delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write
down some comments.

Detailed information of project along with digrams is provided in the Project Description file.
